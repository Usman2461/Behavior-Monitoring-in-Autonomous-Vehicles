# Neuro-Symbolic AV Monitoring

This package implements a simplified Neuro-Symbolic Transformer framework for Autonomous Vehicle (AV) behavior monitoring.

## Structure
- models/: Transformer encoder, Symbolic bridge, Reasoning engine
- losses/: Classification, Logic consistency, Alignment, Symbiotic objective
- evaluation/: Metrics and SHAP-like feature attribution
- run_experiments.py: Main script to train and evaluate pipeline
- results/: Stores logs and generated figures

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_experiments.py
```
